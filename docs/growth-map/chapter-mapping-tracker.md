MLSecOps Field Manual – Chapter Mapping Tracker

A cross-reference index linking raw notes → draft sections → final manuscript chapters.

This tracker ensures that every insight captured in field-manual-growth-map.md eventually flows into the appropriate chapter of the Field Manual and the future book. Update it periodically as sections mature.

How to Use This File

1. Add notes to the Growth Map whenever you learn, fix, break, or secure something.


2. Periodically copy mature notes into the table below under Draft Section.


3. When sections stabilize, move them to Manuscript Chapter.


4. Mark items as “Integrated” once they’re included in a chapter draft.



This produces a clear audit trail of how the book evolves.
