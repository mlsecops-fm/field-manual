MLSecOps Field Manual™ – Growth Map

A working document for capturing operational knowledge as it develops.

This file serves as the staging area for all insights, configurations, discoveries, incidents, and lessons learned during the MLSecOps Lab build-out and field-manual project. Notes added here will later be shaped into the corresponding book chapters.

---

1. Orientation

Capture early impressions and foundational insights on how machine-learning systems differ from traditional systems.

Notes:


---

2. Operating Environment

Document real-world constraints, topology decisions, and infrastructure behaviors observed in the lab.

Notes:


---

3. ML System Anatomy

Record diagrams, component relationships, trust boundaries, and pipeline layouts discovered through implementation.

Notes:


---

4. Threat Modeling

Capture any attack-like, anomalous, or unexpected behaviors encountered while building or testing systems.

Notes:


---

5. Hardening ML Infrastructure

Document every security configuration, hardening measure, and boundary introduced to improve system resilience.

Notes:


---

6. Monitoring and Observability

Track the telemetry signals, dashboards, metrics, and logs that proved useful for monitoring ML systems.

Notes:


---

7. Securing RAG Systems

Record insights related to retrieval pipelines, vector stores, embeddings, and document ingestion.

Notes:


---

8. Securing Agentic Systems

Capture observations from building, testing, and debugging agent workflows and tool-use boundaries.

Notes:


---

9. ML Supply Chain Security

Document model provenance checks, dependency management patterns, integrity verification, and packaging practices.

Notes:


---

10. Secure Deployment & Lifecycle Management

Record operational lessons learned from rolling out, testing, versioning, evaluating, and rolling back models.

Notes:


---

11. Incident Response for ML Systems

Capture procedures, symptoms, indicators, and lessons learned from any ML-related issues requiring triage or containment.

Notes:


---

12. The Consulting Lens

Record repeatable patterns, assessment methods, common organizational gaps, and practical recommendations.

Notes:


---

13. Tools and Commands (RTFM Style)

Collect frequently used commands, utilities, scripts, and reference snippets.

Notes:


---

14. Appendices

Maintain architecture diagrams, reference designs, checklists, and additional supporting materials.
