# **Ethical Use of AI in This Project**

This project adheres to the following **ethical principles** when using AI tools during development:

---

## **1. Transparency**

AI assistance is openly disclosed.
No claims are made that AI-generated content is solely human-authored.

---

## **2. Human Ownership**

All work is:

* designed,
* validated,
* modified,
* integrated, and
* approved

by a human engineer.
AI tools do *not* replace accountability.

---

## **3. No Fabrication or Misrepresentation**

AI-generated text, code, or analysis is **never presented as purely original research**.
Any insights gained from AI tools are considered *advisory*, not authoritative.

---

## **4. Reproducibility**

All modules, labs, and configurations are built or rebuilt by the author to ensure they are:

* understood
* verifiable
* functional
* reproducible

---

## **5. Educational Intent**

AI tools are used primarily to:

* accelerate learning
* explore alternatives
* reduce cognitive load
* assist in drafting and troubleshooting

not to falsely inflate expertise.

---

## **6. Continuous Validation**

Every artifact produced or assisted by AI is tested and inspected before inclusion.

---

## **7. Attribution**

Credit for AI-assisted components is acknowledged in the project documentation.
